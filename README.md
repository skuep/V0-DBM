# V0-DBM
This is a differential pulley system belt mod for the Z-axis on Voron 0.

NOTE: This repository is highly beta, the following things are still not satisfying:
- Idler mount may be a bit crude
- Moving-pulley-bed-part is rather crude
- No idea for well working belt tensioning mechanism on the small belt.
- Kirigami bed support planned
- Endstop problem is still unsolved

You need the following extra parts (is probably missing something):
- 20T pulley for stepper motor
- 20T toothed idler (with bearing ID 3mm)
- 2x M3x40 BHCS
- 5x M3x16 BHCS
- 3x M3x6 BHCS
- 4x M3x8 BHCS
- 22x 0.5mm shim washer

Feel free to use, open issues or leave alone :-)
